          To me, VCCP Ad School represents more than just a learning
          opportunity. It’s a chance to sharpen my craft, push my boundaries,
          and connect with some of the best minds in the industry.

        <p class="to-me-vccp">
          As a South African student, the chance to gain mentorship from
          world-class creatives is truly priceless. It’s not something that
          comes around often, and I see it as a golden opportunity to learn,
          grow, and bring my own perspective into a global creative space.

        <p class="to-me-vccp">
          I don’t take these chances lightly. I’m driven, open-minded, and
          always hungry to level up. I’d love the chance to prove myself at Ad
          School.
